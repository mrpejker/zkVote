# Scaffold ETH 2 + MACI Voting Template

Welcome to the Scaffold ETH 2 + MACI Voting Template! This template is a powerful starting point for developers aiming to build decentralized voting applications that prioritize privacy and resist collusion. Combining the rapid development environment of Scaffold ETH with the innovative Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure (MACI), this template offers a robust foundation for creating secure and transparent voting systems on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- **Voter Registration**: Secure registration process through the MACI contract, enabling eligible voting.
- **Poll Management**: Admins can easily create and manage polls, including question and options setup.
- **Secure Voting**: Leverage MACI's privacy-preserving technology to ensure votes are cast anonymously and securely.
- **Results Display**: Transparent display of poll results after the voting phase concludes.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive admin interface for poll oversight, including current status and results analytics.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following tools installed before you proceed:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

Jumpstart your development with these simple steps:

1. **Clone and Set Up the Project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashgo0018/maci-wrapper.git
cd maci-wrapper
yarn install
```

2. **Download the zkeys for the maci circuits**

In your first terminal window, run:

```bash
yarn download-zkeys
```

3. **Update the environment variables**

Copy the env example files to env files

```bash
cp packages/hardhat/.env.example packages/hardhat/.env
cp packages/nextjs/.env.example packages/nextjs/.env.local
```

Update the values of the env variables in these new .env files

4. **Start a Local Ethereum Network**

In your first terminal window, run:

```bash
yarn chain
```

This initiates a local Ethereum network via Hardhat for development and testing purposes. Adjust the network settings in `hardhat.config.ts` as needed.

5. **Deploy Contracts**

In a second terminal, deploy your test contract with:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

Find the contract in `packages/hardhat/contracts`. This script deploys your contract to the local network, with customization available in `packages/hardhat/deploy`.

6. **Launch the NextJS Application**

In a third terminal, start the NextJS frontend:

```bash
yarn start
```

7. **Compute Results**

- Update `packages/hardhat/deploy-config.json` file, select the network, and in the `Poll` object, update `coordinatorPubkey` to the coordinator public key in the `packages/hardhat/coordinatorKeyPair.json`, and update `useQuadraticVoting` if you want to compute results for a non quadratic vote.
- Merge the poll, using `yarn hardhat merge --poll {poll id}`
- Generate proof, using `yarn hardhat prove --poll {poll id} --output-dir {proof ouput dir} --coordinator-private-key {coordinator private key} --tally-file {tally output file}`

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with your dApp. Modify your app configuration in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts` and `packages/hardhat/constants.ts` as necessary.

The deployed contracts will be saved to the file `packages/hardhat/contractAddresses.json`, this file is compatible with maci cli.

The coordinator keys will be stored in the file `packages/hardhat/coordinatorKeyPair.json`.

## Usage

After setting up the project, you can:

- **Register**: Use the app's interface to register with the MACI contract and gain voting rights.
- **Create Polls**: As an admin, you can create polls with custom questions and options.
- **Vote**: Registered voters can participate in polls, utilizing MACI's secure voting mechanism.
- **View Results**: Access poll outcomes after the voting phase ends.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Monitor and manage ongoing polls, including viewing detailed poll status.
